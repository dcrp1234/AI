# Machine Learning Projects Report

## Project 1: Cat vs. Dog Image Classification

### Overview
The first project focuses on classifying images as either cats or dogs using machine learning techniques.

### Dataset
- Used the Kaggle dataset containing images of cats and dogs [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats
](url)
### Approach

#### Simple Model
- Implemented a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- Trained the model on the dataset to classify images into cat or dog categories.

#### Model with Regularization Techniques
- Enhanced the basic model by incorporating techniques to minimize overfitting:
  - **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes the activations of each layer to stabilize learning and accelerate convergence.
  - **Dropout**: Randomly drops a fraction of neuron units during training to reduce overfitting.

### Results

#### Simple Model
- Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.

#### Regularized Model
- Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set, demonstrating improvement over the simple model.
- Showed reduced overfitting as evidenced by performance metrics on validation data.

## Project 2: Tomato Leaf Disease Classification

### Overview
The second project involves identifying diseases in tomato leaves using machine learning techniques.

### Dataset
- Used a dataset containing images of tomato leaves affected by various diseases.

### Approach

#### Dataset Preprocessing
- Preprocessed images for normalization and augmentation.

#### Model Architecture
- Designed a CNN architecture suitable for multi-class classification of tomato leaf diseases.

#### Training and Evaluation
- Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy.

### Results

- Achieved an overall accuracy of 90% on the test set for disease classification.


## Conclusion

In summary, both projects successfully demonstrate the application of machine learning for image classification tasks. The first project showcased the importance of regularization techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout in improving model performance and reducing overfitting. The second project highlighted the effectiveness of CNNs in classifying complex image data such as tomato leaf diseases.

These projects not only provided hands-on experience in building and evaluating machine learning models but also contributed to understanding the nuances of handling image data in real-world applications.

### Future Work
